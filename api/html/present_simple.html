<p>The simple present is a verb tense with two main uses. We use the simple present tense when an action is happening right now, or when it happens regularly (or unceasingly, which is why it&rsquo;s sometimes called present indefinite). Depending on the person, the simple present tense is formed by using the root form or by adding ‑s or ‑es to the end.</p>

<div>I feel great! Pauline loves pie. I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that you&rsquo;re sick.</div>

The other is to talk about habitual actions or occurrences.
<div>
<div>Pauline practices the piano every day. Ms. Jackson travels during the summer. Hamsters run all night.</div>
</div>
<p>Typically, when we want to describe a temporary action that is currently in progress, we use the present continuous: Pauline can&rsquo;t come to the phone right now because she <strong>is brushing</strong> her teeth.</p>
<h2>How to Form the Simple Present</h2>
<p>In the simple present, most regular verbs use the root form, except in the third-person singular (which ends in <strong>-s</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>First-person singular:</strong> <em>I write</em></p>
<p><strong>Second-person singular:</strong> <em>You write</em></p>
<p><strong>Third-person singular:</strong> <em>He/she/it writes</em> (note the ‑s)</p>
<p><strong>First-person plural:</strong> <em>We write</em></p>
<p><strong>Second-person plural:</strong> <em>You write</em></p>
<p><strong>Third-person plural:</strong> <em>They write</em></p>
<p>For a few verbs, the third-person singular ends with <strong>-es</strong> instead of <strong>-s</strong>. Typically, these are verbs whose root form ends in <strong>o, ch, sh, th, ss, gh,</strong> or <strong>z</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>First-person singular:</strong> <em>I go</em></p>
<p><strong>Second-person singular:</strong> <em>You go</em></p>
<p><strong>Third-person singular:</strong> <em>He/she/it goes</em> (note the ‑es)</p>
<p><strong>First-person plural:</strong> <em>We go</em></p>
<p><strong>Second-person plural:</strong> <em>You go</em></p>
<p><strong>Third-person plural:</strong> <em>They go</em></p>
<p>For most regular verbs, you put the negation of the verb before the verb, e.g. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t go&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t smell anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The verb <strong>to be</strong> is irregular:</p>
<p><strong>First-person singular:</strong> <em>I am</em></p>
<p><strong>Second-person singular:</strong> <em>You are</em></p>
<p><strong>Third-person singular:</strong> <em>He/she/it is</em></p>
<p><strong>First-person plural:</strong> <em>We are</em></p>
<p><strong>Second-person plural:</strong> <em>You are</em></p>
<p><strong>Third-person plural:</strong> <em>They are</em></p>
<h2>How to Make the Simple Present&nbsp;Negative</h2>
<p>The formula for making a simple present&nbsp;verb negative is <strong>do/does + not + [root form of verb]</strong>. You can also use the contraction <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> or <strong>doesn&rsquo;t</strong> instead of <strong>do not</strong> or <strong>does not</strong>.</p>
<div>
<div>Pauline does not want to share the pie. She doesn&rsquo;t think there is enough to go around. Her friends do not agree. I don&rsquo;t want pie anyway.</div>
</div>
<p>To make the verb <strong>to be</strong> negative, the formula is <strong>[to be] + not</strong>.</p>
<div>
<div>I am not a pie lover, but Pauline sure is. You aren&rsquo;t&nbsp;ready for such delicious pie.</div>
</div>
<h2>How to Ask a Question</h2>
<p>The formula for asking a question in the simple present is <strong>do/does + [subject] + [root form of verb]</strong>.</p>
<div>
<div>Do you know how to bake a pie? How much does Pauline love pie?</div>

        <p>Read the following sentence:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hearing</strong> a loud noise, the boy woke up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here the word <strong>hearing</strong> qualifies the noun boy as an adjective does. It is formed from the verb <strong>hear</strong> and has an object – noise. The word hearing, therefore, has the properties of a verb and an adjective and is called a <strong>participle.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>A participle</strong> is a word which is partly a verb and partly an adjective.</p>
        <p>Note that in the example sentence given above, the phrase ‘hearing a loud noise’ which is introduced by a participle is called a participle phrase.</p>
        <p>Study the following examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em><strong>Knocking</strong></em> at the door, he demanded admission.</li>
            <li>We met a girl<em> <strong>carrying </strong></em>a basket full of vegetables.</li>
            <li>The old woman, <em><strong>thinking</strong></em> all was safe, attempted to cross the road.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The italicized words in the above sentences are all examples of what are called <strong>present participle</strong>s. Note that present participles end in <strong>-ing</strong> and represent an action as going on or incomplete or imperfect.</p>
        <p>Present participles formed from transitive verbs, take objects.</p>
        <p>Now study the following sentences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We saw trees <em><strong>laden</strong></em> with fruits.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Deceived</strong></em> by his friends, he committed suicide.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Driven </strong></em>by rain, we took shelter under a tree.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The italicized words in the above sentences are all examples of what are called <strong>past participles.</strong> The past participle usually ends in -ed, -d, -t, -en or -n. It represents a completed action or state.</p>
        <p>Besides the present and past participles, we have what is called a <strong>perfect participle</strong> which represents an action as completed some time in the past.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Having rested</strong> for a while, we continued our journey.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Participles are often used as simple qualifying adjectives in front of nouns.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Barking</strong> dogs seldom bite.</li>
            <li>A <strong>rolling</strong> stone gathers no moss.</li>
            <li>His <strong>tattered </strong>coat needs mending.</li>
            <li>A <strong>burnt </strong>child dreads fire.</li>
            <li>He is a <strong>learned </strong>man.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When used as an adjective, the past participle has a passive meaning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A burnt child = a child who is burnt.</li>
            <li>A painted doll = a doll which is painted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When used as an adjective, the present participle has an active meaning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A barking dog = a dog which barks</li>
            <li>A rolling stone = a stone which rolls</li>
        </ul>

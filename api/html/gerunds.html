    <p><b>A <em>gerund phrase</em> is a phrase consisting of a gerund and any modifiers or objects associated with it.</b> A <b><a href1="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/gerund/">gerund</a></b> is a noun made from a verb root plus <em>ing</em> (a present participle). A whole <b>gerund phrase</b> functions in a sentence just like a noun, and can act as a subject, an object, or a predicate nominative.</p>

    <p>If you look up the <a href1="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gerund" rel="nofollow">definition of gerund</a> (pronounced JER-und), you will find that it means “an English noun formed from a verb by adding -ing”; that is, a present participle used as a noun.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="tool__example ">
        <div class="tool__example-content">Traveling is a good way to expand your worldview.
            <p></p>
            <p>My passion is reading.</p>
            <p>My doctor suggests running to improve my health.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>In all three of these examples, words ending with <em>-ing</em> are acting as nouns. <em>Traveling</em> is the subject of the first sentence. In the second sentence, <em>reading</em> is a predicate nominative, a word (or group of words) that completes a linking verb and renames the subject. The verb <em>is</em>, a form of the linking verb <em>to be</em>, is followed by <em>reading</em>, which renames the subject <em>my passion</em>. In the third sentence, the gerund <em>running</em> is acting as the object of the verb <em>suggests</em>.</p>
    <h2>How Do Gerund Phrases Work? They Act Like a Noun</h2>
    <p>Gerunds can appear alone or band together with other words to form a <b>gerund phrase</b>. Collectively, this phrase behaves like a single noun.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="tool__example ">
        <div class="tool__example-content"><em>Running</em> is a favorite activity of mine.
            <p></p>
            <p><em>Running with scissors</em> is a favorite activity of mine.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>Both the gerund and the <b>gerund phrase</b> above function as subject nouns and take the third-person singular verb <em>is</em>. We could substitute a non-gerund noun such as <em>chess</em> to mentally confirm its function.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="tool__example ">
        <div class="tool__example-content"><em>Chess</em> is a favorite activity of mine.</div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Not Acting Like a Noun? It’s a Participle Phrase</h2>
    <p><b>Gerund phrases</b> can easily be confused with <em>participle phrases</em>. It is possible, for example, to encounter the <b>gerund phrase</b> we used above in a context where it is not acting like a noun. When used as a modifier—that is, as an adjective or adverb—it is now a participle phrase.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="tool__example ">
        <div class="tool__example-content">Running with scissors, Tim charged after the cat.</div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>Here, <em>running with scissors</em> modifies the verb <em>charged</em>. It gives us further information about <em>how</em> Tim charged.</p>
    <h2>Gerund Phrases as Objects</h2>
    <p>Just as nouns sometimes function as objects in a sentence, so can <b>gerund phrases</b>.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="tool__example ">
        <div class="tool__example-content">Tim enjoys <em>running with scissors</em>.</div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>In this sentence, the <b>gerund phrase</b> <em>running with scissors</em> is the direct object of the verb <em>enjoys</em>. We could easily replace it with a simpler object noun to confirm that it really is an object.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="tool__example ">
        <div class="tool__example-content">Tim enjoys <em>racquetball</em>.</div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>(That would be a much better idea, Tim.)</p>
    <p>We could also use this <b>gerund phrase</b> as an indirect object.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="tool__example ">
        <div class="tool__example-content">Tim attributes his high blood pressure to running with scissors.</div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>Like many indirect objects, the <b>gerund phrase</b> <em>running with scissors</em> is introduced with the preposition <em>to</em>.</p>
    <h2>Dangling Gerunds</h2>
    <p>You may have heard of dangling participles; dangling gerunds are quite similar. Dangling gerunds are somewhat less frequent, but they can crop up when gerunds or <b>gerund phrases</b> are acting as objects of a preposition such as <em>before, after, by,</em> or <em>with</em>.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
        <div class="tool__example-content">By running with scissors, Tim’s cat suffered some battle scars.</div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>The <b>gerund phrase</b> is said to be dangling here, because it is mismatched with the subject that follows, creating an illogical scenario. The writer of a such a sentence no doubt intended to convey that when Tim ran with scissors, his cat was injured. But as the sentence reads, it is the (atypically scary) cat who ran with scissors.</p>
    <p>The best thing to do with a sentence that contains a dangler is to rewrite it to give the sentence its proper subject. There may be a number of ways to do that correctly.</p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="tool__example tool__correct">
        <div class="tool__example-content">By running with scissors, Tim gave his cat some battle scars.</div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="tool__example tool__correct">
        <div class="tool__example-content">Tim wounded his cat when he ran with scissors.</div>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <div class="tool__example tool__correct">
        <div class="tool__example-content">Tim’s penchant for running with scissors has left some battle scars on his cat.</div>
    </div>
    <p></p>

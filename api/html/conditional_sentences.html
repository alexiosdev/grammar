            <p>Conditional sentences are statements discussing known factors or hypothetical situations and their consequences. Complete conditional sentences contain a conditional <a href1="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/the-basics-of-clauses-in-english/">clause</a> (often referred to as the if-clause) and the consequence. Consider the following sentences:</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If a certain condition is true, then a particular result happens.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">I would travel around the world if I won the lottery.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example ">

            <p>What Are the Different Types of Conditional Sentences? There are four different types of conditional sentences in English. Each expresses a different degree of probability that a situation will occur or would have occurred under certain circumstances.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zero Conditional Sentences</li>
                <li>First Conditional Sentences</li>
                <li>Second Conditional Sentences</li>
                <li>Third Conditional Sentences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let’s look at each of these different types of conditional sentences in more detail.</p>
            <h2>How to Use Zero Conditional Sentences</h2>
            <p>Zero conditional sentences express general truths—situations in which one thing <em>always</em> causes another. When you use a zero conditional, you’re talking about a general truth rather than a specific instance of something. Consider the following examples:</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If you don’t brush your teeth, you get cavities.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">When people smoke cigarettes, their health suffers.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>There are a couple of things to take note of in the above sentences in which the zero conditional is used. First, when using the zero conditional, the correct tense to use in both clauses is the <a href1="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/simple-present/">simple present tense</a>. A common mistake is to use the simple future tense. </p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
                <div class="tool__example-content">When people smoke cigarettes, their health
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">will suffer</mark>
                    .</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>Secondly, notice that the words <em>if</em> and <em>when</em> can be used interchangeably in these zero conditional sentences. This is because the outcome will always be the same, so it doesn’t matter “if” or “when” it happens.</p>
            <h2>How to Use First Conditional Sentences</h2>
            <p>First conditional sentences are used to express situations in which the outcome is likely (but not guaranteed) to happen in the future. Look at the examples below:</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If you rest, you will feel better.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If you set your mind to a goal, you’ll eventually achieve it.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>Note that we use the simple present tense in the if-clause and simple future tense in the main clause—that is, the clause that expresses the likely outcome. This is how we indicate that under a certain condition (as expressed in the if-clause), a specific result <em>will</em> likely happen in the future. Examine some of the common mistakes people make using the first conditional structure:</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If you
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">will rest</mark>
                    , you will feel better.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example tool__correct">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If you
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">rest</mark>
                    , you will feel better.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> Use the <a href1="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/simple-past/">simple present tense</a> in the if-clause.</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If you set your mind to a goal,
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">you eventually achieve</mark>
                    it.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example tool__correct">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If you set your mind to a goal,
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">you’ll eventually achieve</mark>
                    it.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> Use the zero conditional (i.e., simple present + simple present) only when a certain result is guaranteed. If the result is likely, use the first conditional (i.e., simple present + simple future).</p>
            <h2>How to Use Second Conditional Sentences</h2>
            <p>Second conditional sentences are useful for expressing outcomes that are completely unrealistic or will <em>not</em> likely happen in the future. Consider the examples below:</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If I inherited a billion dollars, I would travel to the moon.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If I owned a zoo, I might let people interact with the animals more.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>Notice the correct way to structure second conditional sentences is to use the simple past tense in the if-clause and an auxiliary modal verb (e.g., could, should, would, might) in the main clause (the one that expresses the unrealistic or unlikely outcome). The following sentences illustrate a couple of the common mistakes people make when using the second conditional:</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If I
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">inherit</mark>
                    a billion dollars, I would travel to the moon.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example tool__correct">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If I
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">inherited</mark>
                    a billion dollars, I would travel to the moon.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> When applying the second conditional, use the simple past tense in the if-clause.</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If I owned a zoo, I
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">will let</mark>
                    people interact with the animals more.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example tool__correct">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If I owned a zoo, I
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">might let</mark>
                    people interact with the animals more.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> Use a modal auxiliary verb in the main clause when using the second conditional mood to express the unlikelihood that the result will actually happen.</p>
            <h2>How to Use Third Conditional Sentences</h2>
            <p>Third conditional sentences are used to explain that present circumstances would be different if something different had happened in the past. Look at the following examples:</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If you had told me you needed a ride, I would have left earlier.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If I had cleaned the house, I could have gone to the movies.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>These sentences express a condition that was likely enough, but did not actually happen in the past. The speaker in the first sentence was capable of leaving early, but did not. Along these same lines, the speaker in the second sentence was capable of cleaning the house, but did not. These are all conditions that were likely, but regrettably did not happen.</p>
            <p>Note that when using the third conditional, we use the <a href1="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/past-perfect/">past perfect</a> (i.e., had + past participle) in the if-clause. The modal auxiliary (would, could, shoud, etc.) + have + past participle in the main clause expresses the theoretical situation that <em>could</em> have happened.</p>
            <p>Consider these common mistakes when applying the third conditional:</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If you
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">would have told</mark>
                    me you needed a ride, I would have left earlier.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example tool__correct">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If you
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">had told</mark>
                    me you needed a ride, I would have left earlier.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> With third conditional sentences, do not use a modal auxiliary verb in the if-clause.</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If I had cleaned the house, I
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">could go</mark>
                    to the movies.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="tool__example tool__correct">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If I had cleaned the house, I
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">could have gone</mark>
                    to the movies.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p><b>Explanation:</b> The third conditional mood expresses a situation that could have only happened in the past if a certain condition had been met. That’s why we use the modal auxiliary verb + have + the past participle.</p>
            <h2>Exceptions and Special Cases When Using Conditional Sentences</h2>
            <p>As with most topics in the English language, conditional sentences often present special cases in which unique rules must be applied.</p>
            <h3> Use of the Simple Future in the If-Clause</h3>
            <p>Generally speaking, the simple future should be used only in the main clause. One exception is when the action in the if-clause will take place <em>after</em> the action in the main clause. For example, consider the following sentence:</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If aspirin will ease my headache, I will take a couple tonight.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>The action in the if-clause is the aspirin easing the headache, which will take place only after the speaker takes them later that night.</p>
            <h3> “Were to” in the If-Clause</h3>
            <p>The verb phrase <em>were to</em> is sometimes used in conditional sentences when the likely or unlikely result is particularly awful or unthinkable. In this case, <em>were to</em> is used to place emphasis on this potential outcome. Consider these sentences:</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If I
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">were to</mark>
                    be sick, I would miss another day of work.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If she
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">were to</mark>
                    be late again, she would have to have a conference with the manager.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If the rent
                    <mark class="tool__keyword">were to</mark>
                    have been a penny more, they would not have been able to pay it.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>Note that the emphatic “were to” can be used to describe hypothetical scenarios in the present, future, and past.</p>
            <h2>Punctuating Conditional Sentences</h2>
            <p>Despite the complex nature of conditional sentences, punctuating them properly is really simple! </p>
            <p>Here’s the skinny:</p>
            <p>Use a comma after the if-clause when the if-clause precedes the main clause.</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">If I’d had time, I would have cleaned the house.</div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>If the main clause precedes the if-clause, no punctuation is necessary.</p>
            <p></p>
            <div class="tool__example ">
                <div class="tool__example-content">I would have cleaned the house if I’d had time.</div>
            </div>

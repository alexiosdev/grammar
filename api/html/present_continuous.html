<p>The present continuous (present progressive) tense is a way to convey any action or condition that is happening <i>right now</i>, <i>frequently, </i>and may be <i>ongoing. </i>It adds energy and action to writing, and its effect helps readers understand <i>when</i> the action is happening. Imagine Aunt Christine has surprised her nephew Scott for his birthday and is going to take him out to his favorite restaurant, Polly’s Pancake Diner. If I wanted to tell the story <i>after it happened, </i>I’d use the past tense:</p>
<p></p><div class="tool__example ">
    <div class="tool__example-content">They <b>waited</b> at the red light, and Scott <b>worried</b> they might miss their reservation. (Past tense)</div>
    </div>
<p></p>
<p>But what I really want to convey is how the event <i>unfolded</i>, showing the action <i>as it is happening:</i></p>
<p></p><div class="tool__example ">
    <div class="tool__example-content">They <b>are sitting</b> at Scott’s favorite booth, the one with the sparkling red plastic seats.(For how long? We don’t know, but we <i>do</i> know they are sitting there <i>now.</i>)</div>
    </div>

<div class="tool__example ">
    <div class="tool__example-content">The waiter <b>is standing</b> behind the counter right now with a notepad in his hand and pencil behind his ear. (Will he ever make it over to the booth? Probably, but not <i>now.</i>)</div>
    </div>

<div class="tool__example ">
    <div class="tool__example-content">“<b>Are</b> you <b>waiting</b> to open your presents after you eat your pancakes?” said Aunt Christine, taking a sip from her root beer. (Here the present continuous is being used in question form.)</div>
    </div>
<p></p>
<p>From this narrative point of view, the action is immediate and continuous; there’s momentum. Sometimes writers use this tense to add suspense or humor in fictional pieces. What kind of pancakes will Scott and his aunt order? The suspense <b>is killing </b>me!</p>
<h2>The Present Continuous Formula</h2>
<p>To form the present continuous, follow this formula:</p>
<p><b>To Be [Am, Is, Are] + Verb [Present Participle] </b></p>
<h2>When to Use the Present Continuous Tense</h2>
<p>Use the present continuous tense with the appropriate <b>“to be”</b> verb and a <b>dynamic</b> verb.
A <b>dynamic</b> verb shows action and/or process. For example,</p>
<p></p><div class="tool__example ">
    <div class="tool__example-content">Scott’s little sister <b>is arriving</b> at the diner two hours late because her roller-derby team, Chicks Ahoy, won the national championships early today. As she <b>is walking</b> into Polly’s Pancake Diner, she <b>is yelling</b> goodbye to her friends outside, and Scott hopes she doesn’t cause a scene since she <b>is</b> always <b>embarrassing</b> him in public.</div>
    </div>
<p></p>
<h2>When Not to Use the Present Continuous Tense</h2>
<p>Do not use the present continuous tense with <b>stative</b> verbs. Stative verbs show a state of being that does not show qualities of change. These verbs can stay in the simple present. For example,</p>
<p></p><div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
    <div class="tool__example-content">Aunt Christine <b>is preferring</b> the maple walnut pancakes over the banana peanut butter ones that Scott loves.</div>
    </div>

<div class="tool__example tool__correct">
    <div class="tool__example-content">Aunt Christine <b>prefers</b> the maple walnut pancakes over the banana peanut butter ones that Scott loves.</div>
    </div>
<p></p>
<p>Here, the stative verb <i>to prefer</i> shows opinion, and therefore should not be conjugated into the present continuous. Stative verb categories include emotion (to love), possession (to belong), and thoughts (to recognize), and none of these should use the present continuous form.</p>
<h2>The Exception to the Rule</h2>
<p>Some verbs can be both dynamic and stative! Think about the verbs <b>to be </b>and <b>to think. </b>
In its dynamic form, the verb <b>to be</b> can show action:</p>
<p></p><div class="tool__example ">
    <div class="tool__example-content">Sarah, Scott’s little sister, <b>is being </b>bold by ordering the jalapeno-chipotle pancakes.</div>
    </div>
<p></p>
<p>But in its stative form, the verb <b>to be </b>is awkward if conjugated in the present continuous.</p>
<p></p><div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
    <div class="tool__example-content">Sarah <b>is being </b>a tall teenager, who loves her food spicy and her sports dangerous.</div>
    </div>

<div class="tool__example tool__correct">
    <div class="tool__example-content">Sarah <b>is</b> a tall teenageer, who loves her food spicy and her sports dangerous.</div>
    </div>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some more examples:</p>
<p></p><div class="tool__example ">
    <div class="tool__example-content">The waiter <b>thinks</b> Scott should save room for pumpkin pie. (Stative and in the simple present) </div>
    </div>

<div class="tool__example ">
    <div class="tool__example-content">The waiter <b>is thinking</b> about getting a new job that requires less human interaction, like a veterinarian. (Dynamic and in the present continuous)</div>
    </div>
<p></p>
<h2>Idiomatic Expressions and Style</h2>
<p>English can be confusing; what is grammatically correct isn’t always what you might hear in music, in advertisements, or during regular conversations. The present continuous is often used incorrectly. Consider the the popular slogan for McDonald’s: “I’m Lovin’ It.” This is a grammatically incorrect sentence because <i>to love</i> is a stative verb, so why would McDonald’s use it in their advertisements?</p>
<p>This marks the difference between grammar and style. Using the present continuous as a means to <i>exaggerate</i> is a stylistic trend, and as such, it would not be surprising to hear this conversation:</p>
<p></p><div class="tool__example ">
    <div class="tool__example-content">Scott, glazed with a chocolate mustache, looks over to his aunt and says, <b>“I’m lovin’ </b>me some of these chocolate peanut butter banana pancakes!”
<b>“I’m hearing</b> what <b>you’re saying!” </b>she replies, sprinkling powdered sugar atop the stacks on her plate.</div>
    </div>
<p></p>
<p>Here Scott and his Aunt display their excitement in a silly way, emphasizing their feelings. On the other hand, you would <b>never</b> hear a native speaker say these sentences:</p>
<p></p><div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
    <div class="tool__example-content">Scott <b>is loving</b> his Aunt Christine, a self-proclaimed pancake connoisseur. (People would simply say “Scott <b>loves </b>his Aunt Christine . . .”)</div>
    </div>

<div class="tool__example tool__incorrect">
    <div class="tool__example-content">Sarah <b>is hearing</b> the music from their table-top juke box and resists the urge to dance on the table. (Sarah <b>hears </b>the music. . .) </div>
    </div>
<p></p>
<h2>The Final Say</h2>
<p>If you are teaching English or learning it, I’d recommend simply sticking to grammatically correct constructions and leaving the idiomatic expressions to the creators of advertisements and song lyrics. In formal writing, the experts recommend that when you can use fewer words to express a thought, you should, so use the present continuous sparingly—short and sweet can’t be beat!</p>

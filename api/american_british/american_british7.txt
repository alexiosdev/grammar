Using the British has got, in this case (when it means has acquired or obtained), makes you sound not well educated to an American.\n2. In the U.S. gotten is frequently used as the past participle of get. Phrases that involve some sort of process also use gotten.\nPaul's grades have gotten better since he moved out of the fraternity house and quit drinking.\n3. Note: In American English, have got is used to mean possess, must, and have to.\nHe's got today's newspaper. \u2014*has\nIt's late, and I've got to go now. \u2014* must\/have to\n4. Compare:\nLila has got just four dollars to buy her lunch.\n\u2014>- Implying current possession\nLilly has gotten five dollars for babysitting Tilly.\nEmphasizing the earning of the money rather than its possession\n5. This shows that in America people have kept using both have got and have gotten, but the two verb phrases have different meanings. It is not that Americans speak improper English, but that they have made the English language richer.\n6. This is a very important difference between have got and have gotten. In this case, we hope British English will follow American English someday. Let's wait and see what the British will do.","category":"3","subcategorylv1":"31","subcategorylv2":"7","type":"3"},{"question":"Does Susan have a computer?","a":"  American English","b":"  British English","answer":"1","category":"3","subcategorylv1":"31","subcategorylv2":"7","type":"3"},{"question":"Has Susan a computer?","a":"  American English","b":"  British English","answer":"2","category":"3","subcategorylv1":"31","subcategorylv2":"7","type":"3"}]}

In modern American English, neither of is often followed by a plural noun and a plural verb. Americans think that since the noun (sisters) that is close to the verb is plural, the verb should be plural, too.\n2. In British English, neither of, when used as the subject of a sentence, is usually followed by a singular verb. British people think that since the subject is neither (not the noun sisters), a singular verb should be used. But in spoken English, British people sometimes use a plural verb. Isn't British English grammar complicated!\n3. In other words, this might not be a difference between American English and British English, but a difference between modern English and traditional English.\n(1) The traditional rule holds that neither is grammatically singular:\n\nNeither politician is completely honest in answering difficult questions while campaigning to be elected governor.\n\n(2) However, in modern English neither, when followed by of and a plural noun, is now often used with a plural verb.\n\nNeither of the politicians are completely honest in answering difficult questions while campaigning to be elected governor.","category":"3","subcategorylv1":"31","subcategorylv2":"8","type":"3"},{"question":"None of those buses go downtown.","a":"  American English","b":"  British English","answer":"1","category":"3","subcategorylv1":"31","subcategorylv2":"8","type":"3"},{"question":"None of those buses goes downtown.","a":"  American English","b":"  British English","answer":"2","category":"3","subcategorylv1":"31","subcategorylv2":"8","type":"3"},{"question":"None of us is perfect.","a":"  American English","b":"  British English","answer":"2","category":"3","subcategorylv1":"31","subcategorylv2":"8","type":"3"},{"question":"None of us are perfect.","a":"  American English","b":"  British English","answer":"1","explain":"\n1. none of + plural noun + plural verb\n2. American English\nMany people have been taught that none is equivalent to no one or not one (of them) and therefore requires a singular verb and singular pronoun, as in \"None of us is perfect. \"\nBut many American scholars believe that none is closer in meaning to not any (of them) than to not one (of them). So they think none, in the structure none of + plural noun or plural pronoun, is plural and takes a plural verb.\n\nNone of them were playboys.\nNone of the women were having their periods.\n\n3. British English\nIn British English, when none of is followed by a plural noun or a plural pronoun, a singular verb is used in formal writing, because British people think that none means no one or not one (of them). However, in spoken English, British people follow the American way and often use the plural form.\n\nNone of the girls snores.\nformal\nNone of the pilots was willing to miss his or her chance for some sleep.\nformal\n\n4. Perhaps in a few decades British people in their formal writing will also follow Uncle Sam's English and say, \"None of us are perfect.\" The structure none of us is perfect will disappear from grammar books. In other words, it is not a difference between American English and British English, but a difference between modern English and traditional English.","category":"3","subcategorylv1":"31","subcategorylv2":"8","type":"3"},{"question":"He likes to wear pink trousers.","a":"  American English","b":"  British English","answer":"2","category":"3","subcategorylv1":"31","subcategorylv2":"8","type":"3"},{"question":"He likes to wear pink pants.","a":"  American English","b":"  British English","answer":"1","explain":"\n1.
